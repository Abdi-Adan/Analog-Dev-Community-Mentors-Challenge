### Project Challenge

The regulation of utilities such as water, electricity, and gas is a crucial problem for urban
families. Controlling the consumption of such commodities relies upon daily decisions one has
to make with regards to the economic value. It would save a lot of people money and
convenience if they knew how much gas, water, and electricity they consumed daily and the
associated cost.

### Goal

Design a simple web application that simulates a utility digital meter that indicates daily
consumption. For gas, indicate if the gas is almost empty and a time estimate left until it is
unusable. Your simulation should be set at a randomized range of consumption rate for each
utility to indicate the normal usage within a normal home. Such information is confidential.
